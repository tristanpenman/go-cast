# Plan

- Receiver
  + ~~Implement enough receiver functionality to advertise an app~~
  + ~~Launch apps~~
  + ~~Properly handle CONNECT messages and transport logic~~
  + Receive and decrypt RTP stream (in progress)
  + Forward video content to ffmpeg or mpv (in progress)
- Sender
  + Basic structure for sender communication (in progress)
  + Allow sender to cast a video
  + Allow sender to cast screen (feasible in Go?)
  + ...
- Misc
  + Integrated video output
  + More protocol documentation
  + ...
